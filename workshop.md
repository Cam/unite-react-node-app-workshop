### Let’s build an app!

#### Step 1. Cloning the repo
We'll start by cloning this repo.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Shopify/unite-react-node-app-workshop.git
```
You should see a structure that looks like this:

#### Step 2: Hello, Koa
Koa is the server framework we’ll be using for our server. It’s a minimalistic framework for modern JS apps, built around the `async` and `await` keywords.

In Koa you express your application logic as a series of asynchronous functions functions called middleware. These functions all operate on a `context` or `ctx` object, and await on a `next` function to yield flow back into the rest of the app.

#### Step 3: Authing with Shopify
#### Step 4: React and webpack
#### Step 5: Our first React component
#### Step 6: Routing with react
#### Step 7: Making an API request
#### Step 8: Webhooks
